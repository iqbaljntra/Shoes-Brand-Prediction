# Shoes-Brand-Prediction
The goal of the image `classification model`, To build a `Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)` model for this image classification task is to predict the brand of a shoes given an image of the shoes. The 3 classes in question are `Adidas, Converse, and Nike`. The training data for the model consists of images of shoes and their corresponding labels, with each label indicating the brand of the shoe in the image.

So, the conclusion is that building a `CNN mode`l for the image `classification` task of predicting the brand of a shoe given an image of the shoe involves preprocessing the training data, splitting it into a training set and a validation set, designing a suitable model architecture, `training the model, and evaluating its performance.`
